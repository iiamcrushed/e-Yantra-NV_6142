def detect_lane(frame):
    '''
    Purpose:
    ---
    Work out, from a single camera frame, how wrong the vehicle currently is -
    and hand back whatever `compute_control()` needs in order to correct it.

    This is your Task 1C detector, extended. Task 1C answered *where the lane
    centre is* and *which lane the vehicle is in*; a controller cannot use
    either of those directly. It needs to know how far the vehicle is from
    where it should be, and which way it is pointing.

    Input Arguments:
    ---
    `frame` :   [ numpy.ndarray ]
        One BGR frame from the vehicle's camera, of shape (height, width, 3),
        the right way up and in the right colour order.

    Returns:
    ---
    Anything you like - a tuple, a dictionary, your own class. Whatever you
    return here is passed straight to compute_control() and nowhere else, so
    the two functions only have to agree with each other.

    Example call:
    ---
    detection = detect_lane(frame)

    REMEMBER:
    ---
    Both lanes are driven during evaluation, and the arena looks mirrored from
    the other one. Do not hard-code which side the boundary is on.

    Do NOT call cv2.imshow() or cv2.imwrite() from inside this function.

    You are marked on how closely you hold the MIDDLE of your lane, not merely
    on staying the correct side of the dashed line.

    return None


def compute_control(detection, stop_requested):
    '''
    Purpose:
    ---
    Turn the errors from detect_lane() into the three numbers the vehicle is
    driven with, and obey the stop flag.

    This is where your Task 1B controller and your Task 1A steering geometry
    meet: work out one steering angle from the error, then split it into the
    two front-wheel angles the joints actually take.

    Input Arguments:
    ---
    `detection` :   [ any ]
        Whatever detect_lane() returned for this frame.

    `stop_requested` :  [ bool ]
        True while the evaluation is holding the vehicle at a stop point.
        This is a LEVEL, not a pulse: it stays True for the whole duration of
        the stop and goes False when the wait is over. While it is True the
        vehicle must be STATIONARY, so return a speed of 0.0. There is no
        stopwatch for you to write and no duration to hard-code.

    Returns:
    ---
    `left_angle`, `right_angle` :   [ float ]
        The two front-wheel steering angles, in RADIANS, written straight to
        the steering joints. The scene's steering joints are POSITIVE TO THE
        LEFT. Nothing is clamped for you - the vehicle's own limit is 45
        degrees, and commanding past it will not steer any harder.

    `speed` :   [ float ]
        Target velocity for both drive motors, in rad/s. 0.0 holds the
        vehicle still.

    Example call:
    ---
    left_angle, right_angle, speed = compute_control(detection, stop_requested)

    REMEMBER:
    ---
    Keep the loop running while stopped - set the SPEED to zero, not your
    program. If you stop reading frames you will not see the flag drop.

    Sooner or later a frame comes back with nothing usable in it. Holding the
    last steering angle, easing off the throttle and stopping dead are all
    defensible - doing nothing is not.

    The vision sensor hands back a raw byte buffer and a resolution, not an
    image, and three corrections are needed to turn one into the other. None
    of these problems announces itself - each produces a detector that looks
    like it is working on a frame that is wrong:

      * handleVisionSensor() - this scene's sensor renders only when asked.
        Without it every read returns the SAME frame for the whole lap.
      * cv2.flip(frame, 0) - the buffer's first row is the BOTTOM of the
        image, so the road comes out vertically mirrored.
      * RGB2BGR - the buffer is RGB and OpenCV assumes BGR. Without the swap
        every HSV threshold you tuned in Task 1C selects the wrong colour.

    Note `res[1], res[0]` in the reshape too: the resolution comes back as
    (width, height) while NumPy wants rows first.

    Returns None if no frame is ready yet, which happens on the first few
    iterations after the simulation starts.
